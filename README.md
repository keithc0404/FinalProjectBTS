I faced difficulty organizing and making sure everything ran correctly with correct amounts initally. It took me more time than anticipated to get the code working perfect. The only thing I wish I could have done was add graphics using pygame to make it more real. I do not believe we used Global in class but the use of global and .format helped me organize and get the code simpler.
